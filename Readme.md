# Python Journey 🚀

This repository is my day-to-day Python learning journal.

I use this space to post:
- daily Python practice
- mini-projects built while learning
- code experiments
- notes and progress updates

The goal is simple: **learn consistently, build consistently, improve consistently.**

## 📌 Purpose of This Repo

This is a personal learning repository where I document my Python journey from fundamentals to real-world projects.

I am using this repo to:
- track my learning progress publicly
- practice writing clean, readable code
- build problem-solving skills through hands-on tasks
- create small projects as I learn new concepts

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here

- Beginner to intermediate Python exercises  
- Topic-based practice (strings, loops, functions, OOP, file handling, etc.)  
- Small utilities and mini-projects  
- Jupyter notebooks and `.py` scripts  
- Regular updates as I continue learning
